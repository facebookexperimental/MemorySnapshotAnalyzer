## Treat delegates as weak
##
## Delegates can hold on to references(and, possibly, large object graphs) via their closures, and delegates are often used
## to connect otherwise independent subsystems for notification delivery.This means that references to other objects from
## delegate closures usually do not contribute to the "ownership" relationship between objects and are more incidental.
## With the `'weakdelegates` option, such references are treated as "weak" - if objects are reachable both from other
## object fields and from delegate closures, we will ignore the delegate closure reference. If an object is reachable
## *only* from the delegate closure, it is a likely leak candidate, which will be shown with a `..` prefix in backtraces.
